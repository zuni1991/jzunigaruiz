                  was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980's. He created the language when he was working in his PHD thesis in Cambridge University in England.
                The first original name was C with classes. In 1985 C++ was implemented commercialy
                In 1989 it was updated to include protected and static members, as well as inheritance from several classes.
